  <h1>Privacy Policy for Uworld2Anki</h1>
  <p>Last Updated: Sunday March 23, 2025</p>
  
  <p>Thank you for using Uworld2Anki ("the Extension"). Your privacy is very important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle any information that the extension may access or store and ensures that your data remains secure.</p>
  
  <h2>Information Collection and Storage</h2>
  <p>The Uworld2Anki extension <strong>does not collect, store, or share any personal data</strong> from its users. All configuration settings (such as your OpenAI API key, prompt template, model, max tokens, and temperature) are stored locally in your browser using Chrome's <code>chrome.storage.sync</code> API. This data is used solely to customize your experience and is not transmitted to any external servers.</p>
  
  <h2>How Your Information is Used</h2>
  <p>All settings you enter into Uworld2Anki remain on your device. The extension operates entirely on your local machine, and we do not have access to any of your data. Any interactions with the OpenAI API are performed based on your inputs and settings, and we do not log or record these interactions.</p>
  
  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The extension makes use of the OpenAI API to generate content. For information on how OpenAI handles data, please refer to their <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>. We do not control OpenAI's data practices, so we encourage you to review their policies.</p>
  
  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. It is your responsibility to review this policy periodically.</p>
  
  <h2>Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at [your contact email].</p>
  
  <p>By using Uworld2Anki, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
